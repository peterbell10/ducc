# Elementary demo for the ducc0.sht interface using a Gauss-Legendre grid
# I'm not sure I have a perfect equivalent for the DH grid(s) at the moment,
# since they apparently do not include the South Pole. The Clenshaw-Curtis
# and Fejer quadrature rules are very similar (see the documentation in
# sharp_geomhelpers.h). An exact analogon to DH can be added easily, I expect.

# create a set of spherical harmonic coefficients to transform
# Libsharp works exclusively on real-valued maps. The corresponding harmonic
# coefficients are termed a_lm; they are complex numbers with 0<=m<=lmax and
# m<=l<=lmax.
# Symmetry: a_l,-m = (-1)**m*conj(a_l,m).
# The symmetry implies that all coefficients with m==0 are purely real-valued.
# The a_lm are stored in a 1D complex-valued array, in the following order:
# a_(0,0), a(1,0), ..., a_(lmax,0), a(1,1), a(2,1), ... a(lmax,1), ..., a(lmax, mmax)
